# /lmg/ dataset

The data will be generated by gpt-4, and therefore is subject to OpenAI ToS.

- We want 1 million GPT-4 answers to train something like Orca https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02707.pdf
- The idea would be to also use FLAN-V2 instructions asking it to "explain like I'm five"
- Once we have the 1 million instructions, the scraper should automatically fetch instructions that still need to be prompted, control the browser or use the API to get the GPT-4 responses, do some basic quality check and then create a PR to add the data to the dataset
